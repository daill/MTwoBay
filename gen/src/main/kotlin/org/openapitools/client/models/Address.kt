/**
 * This type is used to define the physical address of an inventory location.
 * @param addressLine1 The first line of a street address. This field is required for store inventory locations that will be holding In-Store Pickup inventory. A street address is not required if the inventory location is not holding In-Store Pickup Inventory. This field will be returned if defined for an inventory location. <br/><br/><b>Max length</b>: 128
 * @param addressLine2 The second line of a street address. This field can be used for additional address information, such as a suite or apartment number. A street address is not required if the inventory location is not holding In-Store Pickup Inventory. This field will be returned if defined for an inventory location. <br/><br/><b>Max length</b>: 128
 * @param city The city in which the inventory location resides. This field is required for store inventory locations that will be holding In-Store Pickup inventory. For warehouse locations, this field is technically optional, as a <strong>postalCode</strong> can be used instead of  <strong>city</strong>/<strong>stateOrProvince</strong> pair, and then the city is just derived from this postal/zip code. This field is returned if defined for an inventory location. <br/><br/><b>Max length</b>: 128
 * @param country The country in which the address resides, represented as two-letter <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html \" title=\"https://www.iso.org \" target=\"_blank\">ISO 3166</a> country code. For example, <code>US</code> represents the United States, and <code>DE</code> represents Germany. <br/><br/><b>Max length</b>: 2 For implementation help, refer to <a href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/account/types/CountryCodeEnum\"'>eBay API documentation</a>
 * @param county The county in which the address resides. This field is returned if defined for an inventory location.
 * @param postalCode The postal/zip code of the address. eBay uses postal codes to surface In-Store Pickup items within the vicinity of a buyer's location, and it also user postal codes (origin and destination) to estimate shipping costs when the seller uses calculated shipping. A <strong>city</strong>/<strong>stateOrProvince</strong> pair can be used instead of a <strong>postalCode</strong> value, and then the postal code is just derived from the city and state/province. This field is returned if defined for an inventory location. <br/><br/><b>Max length</b>: 16
 * @param stateOrProvince The state/province in which the inventory location resides. This field is required for store inventory locations that will be holding In-Store Pickup inventory.
