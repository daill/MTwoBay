 * This type is used by the <strong>intervals</strong> container to define the opening and closing times of a store's working day. Local time (in Military format) is used, with the following format: <code>hh:mm:ss</code>.
 * @param close The <strong>close</strong> value is actually the time that the store closes. Local time (in Military format) is used. So, if a store closed at 8 PM local time, the <strong>close</strong> time would look like the following: <code>20:00:00</code>. This field is conditionally required if the <strong>intervals</strong> container is used to specify working hours or special hours for a store. <br/><br/>This field is returned if set for the store location.
 * @param open The <strong>open</strong> value is actually the time that the store opens. Local time (in Military format) is used. So, if a store opens at 9 AM local time, the <strong>close</strong> time would look like the following: <code>09:00:00</code>. This field is conditionally required if the <strong>intervals</strong> container is used to specify working hours or special hours for a store. <br/><br/>This field is returned if set for the store location.
