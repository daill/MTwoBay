 * This type is used to define specific shipping regions.

 * @param regionName A string that indicates the name of a region, as defined by eBay. A \"region\" can be either a 'world region' (e.g., the \"Middle East\" or \"Southeast Asia\"), a country (represented with a two-letter country code), a state or province (represented with a two-letter code), or a special domestic region within a country. <br /><br />The <b>GeteBayDetails</b> call in the Trading API can be used to retrieve the world regions and special domestic regions within a specific country. To get these enumeration values, call <b>GeteBayDetails</b> with the <b>DetailName</b> value set to <b>ExcludeShippingLocationDetails</b>.
