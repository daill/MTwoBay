 * This type is used by the <strong>compatibilityProperties</strong> container to identify a motor vehicle using name/value pairs.
 * @param name This string value identifies the motor vehicle aspect, such as 'make', 'model', 'year', 'trim', and 'engine'. Typically, the make, model, and year of the motor vehicle are always required, with the trim and engine being necessary sometimes, but it will be dependent on the part or accessory, and on the vehicle class.
 * @param value This string value identifies the motor vehicle aspect specified in the corresponding <strong>name</strong> field. For example, if the <strong>name</strong> field is 'make', this field may be 'Toyota', or if the <strong>name</strong> field is 'model', this field may be 'Camry'.
