 * This type is used to enable the use of a sales tax table, to pass in a tax exception category code, or to specify a VAT percentage.
 * @param applyTax This field will be included and set to <code>true</code> if the seller would like to reference their account-level Sales Tax Table to calculate sales tax for an order. A seller's Sales Tax Table can be created and managed manually in My eBay's Payment Preferences. This Sales Tax Table contains all tax jurisdictions for the seller's country (individual states and territories in US), and the seller can set the sales tax rate for these individual tax jurisdictions. <br/><br/> The Trading API has a <a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/Devzone/XML/docs/Reference/eBay/SetTaxTable.html\" target=\"_blank\">SetTaxTable</a> call to add/modify sales tax rates for one or more tax jurisdictions, and a <a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/Devzone/XML/docs/Reference/eBay/GetTaxTable.html\" target=\"_blank\">GetTaxTable</a> call that will retrieve all tax jurisdictions and related data, such as the sales tax rate (if defined) and a boolean field to indicate if sales tax is applied to shipping and handling costs.<br/><br/> The Account API has a <strong>getSalesTaxTable</strong> call to retrieve all tax jurisdictions that have a defined sales tax rate, a <strong>getSalesTaxTableEntry</strong> call to retrieve a sales tax rate for a specific tax jurisdiction, a <strong>createSalesTaxTableEntry</strong> call to set/modify a sales tax rate for a specific tax jurisdiction, and a <strong>deleteSalesTaxTableEntry</strong> call to remove a sales tax rate from a specific tax jurisdiction. <br/><br/>Note that a seller can enable the use of a sales tax table, but if a sales tax rate is not specified for the buyer's state/tax jurisdiction, sales tax will not be applied to the order. If a <strong>thirdPartyTaxCategory</strong> value is used, the <strong>applyTax</strong> field must also be used and set to <code>true</code><br/><br/>This field will be returned if set for the offer.<br/><br/>See the <a href=\"https://pages.ebay.com/help/pay/checkout-tax-table.html\" target=\"_blank\">Using a tax table</a> help page for more information on setting up and using a sales tax table.
 * @param thirdPartyTaxCategory The tax exception category code. If this field is used, sales tax will also apply to a service/fee, and not just the item price. This is to be used only by sellers who have opted into sales tax being calculated by a sales tax calculation vendor. If you are interested in becoming a tax calculation vendor partner with eBay, contact <a href=\"mailto:developer-relations@ebay.com\">developer-relations@ebay.com</a>. One supported value for this field is <code>WASTE_RECYCLING_FEE</code>. If this field is used, the <strong>applyTax</strong> field must also be used and set to <code>true</code><br/><br/>This field will be returned if set for the offer.
 * @param vatPercentage This value is the Value Add Tax (VAT) rate for the item, if any. When a VAT percentage is specified, the item's VAT information appears on the listing's View Item page. In addition, the seller can choose to print an invoice that includes the item's net price, VAT percent, VAT amount, and total price. Since VAT rates vary depending on the item and on the user's country of residence, a seller is responsible for entering the correct VAT rate; it is not calculated by eBay. <br/><br/> To use VAT, a seller must be a business seller with a VAT-ID registered with eBay, and must be listing the item on a VAT-enabled site. Max applicable length is 6 characters, including the decimal (e.g., 12.345). The scale is 3 decimal places. (If you pass in 12.3456, eBay may round up the value to 12.346).<br/><br/>This field will be returned if set for the offer.
