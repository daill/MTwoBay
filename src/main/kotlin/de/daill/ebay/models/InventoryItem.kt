/**
 * This type is used to provide detailed information about an inventory item.
 * @param availability 
 * @param condition This enumeration value indicates the condition of the item. Supported item condition values will vary by eBay site and category. To see which item condition values that a particular eBay category supports, use the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/metadata/resources/marketplace/methods/getItemConditionPolicies\">getItemConditionPolicies</a> method of the <strong>Metadata API</strong>. This method returns condition ID values that map to the enumeration values defined in the <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/inventory/types/slr:ConditionEnum\">ConditionEnum</a> type. The <a href=\"/api-docs/sell/static/metadata/condition-id-values.html\">Item condition ID and name values</a> topic in the <strong>Selling Integration Guide</strong> has a table that maps condition ID values to <strong>ConditionEnum</strong> values. The <strong>getItemConditionPolicies</strong> call reference page has more information.<br><br> A <strong>condition</strong> value is optional up until the seller is ready to publish an offer with the SKU, at which time it becomes required for most eBay categories. For implementation help, refer to <a href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/inventory/types/slr:ConditionEnum'>eBay API documentation</a>
 * @param conditionDescription This string field is used by the seller to more clearly describe the condition of a used inventory item, or an inventory item whose <strong>condition</strong> value is not <code>NEW</code>, <code>LIKE_NEW</code>, <code>NEW_OTHER</code>, or <code>NEW_WITH_DEFECTS</code>.<br/><br/> The <strong>conditionDescription</strong> field is available for all eBay categories. If the <strong>conditionDescription</strong> field is used with an item in one of the new conditions (mentioned in previous paragraph), eBay will simply ignore this field if included, and eBay will return a warning message to the user. <br/><br/> This field should only be used to further clarify the condition of the used item. It should not be used for branding, promotions, shipping, returns, payment or other information unrelated to the condition of the used item. Make sure that the <strong>condition</strong> value, condition description, listing description, and the item's pictures do not contradict one another. <br /><br /> This field is not always required, but is required if an inventory item is being updated and a condition description already exists for that inventory item. <br /><br /> This field is returned in the <strong>getInventoryItem</strong> and <strong>getInventoryItems</strong> calls if a condition description was provided for a used inventory item.<br/><br/><strong>Max Length</strong>: 1000.
