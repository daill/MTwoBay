In this string field, the seller will specify the product aspect where the variations of the inventory item group vary, such as color.

 * @param specifications This container consists of an array of one or more product aspects where each variation differs, and values for each of those product aspects. This container is not immediately required, but will be required before the first offer of the inventory item group is published. <br><br>If a product aspect is specified in the <strong>aspectsImageVariesBy</strong> container, this product aspect (along with all variations of that product aspect) must be included in the <strong>specifications</strong> container. Before offers related to the inventory item group are published, the product aspects and values specified through the <strong>specifications</strong> container should be in synch with the name-value pairs specified through the <strong>product.aspects</strong> containers of the inventory items contained in the group. For example, if <code>Color</code> and <code>Size</code> are in this <strong>specifications</strong> container, each inventory item of the group should also have <code>Color</code> and <code>Size</code> as aspect names in their inventory item records.<br><br/>This container is always returned if one or more offers associated with the inventory item group have been published. For inventory item groups that have yet to have any published offers, this container is only returned if set.
