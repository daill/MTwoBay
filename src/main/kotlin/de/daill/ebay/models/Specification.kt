 * This type is used to specify product aspects for which variations within an inventory item group vary, and the order in which they appear in the listing. For example, t-shirts in an inventory item group may be available in multiple sizes and colors.
 * @param name This is the name of product variation aspect. Typically, for clothing, typical aspect names are <code>\"Size\"</code> and <code>\"Color\"</code>. Product variation aspects are not required immediately upon creating an inventory item group, but these aspects will be required before a multiple-variation listing containing this inventory item group is published.

 * @param values This is an array of values pertaining to the corresponding product variation aspect (specified in the <strong>name</strong> field).
