 * This type is used by the <strong>inventoryItems</strong> container that is returned in the response of the <strong>bulkMigrateListing</strong> call. Up to five <strong>sku</strong>/<strong>offerId</strong> pairs may be returned under the <strong>inventoryItems</strong> container, dependent on how many eBay listings the seller is attempting to migrate to the inventory model.
 * @param offerId Upon a successful migration of a listing, eBay auto-generates this unique identifier, and this offer ID value will be used to retrieve and manage the newly-created offer object. This value will only be generated and returned if the eBay listing is migrated successfully.
 * @param sku This is the seller-defined SKU value associated with the item(s) in a listing. This same SKU value will be used to retrieve and manage the newly-created inventory item object if the listing migration is successful. This SKU value will get returned even if the migration is not successful.
