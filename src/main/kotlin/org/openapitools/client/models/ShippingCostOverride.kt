/**
 * This type is used if the seller wants to override the shipping costs or surcharge associated with a specific domestic or international shipping service option defined in the fulfillment listing policy that is being applied toward the offer. The shipping-related costs that can be overridden include the shipping cost to ship one item, the shipping cost to ship each additional item (if multiple quantity are purchased), and the shipping surcharge applied to the shipping service option.
 * @param additionalShippingCost 
 * @param priority The integer value input into this field, along with the <strong>shippingServiceType</strong> value, sets which domestic or international shipping service option in the fulfillment policy will be modified with updated shipping costs. Specifically, the <strong>shippingCostOverrides.shippingServiceType</strong> value in a <strong>createOffer</strong> or <strong>updateOffer</strong> call must match the <strong>shippingOptions.optionType</strong> value in a fulfillment listing policy, and the <strong>shippingCostOverrides.priority</strong> value in a <strong>createOffer</strong> or <strong>updateOffer</strong> call must match the <strong>shippingOptions.shippingServices.sortOrderId</strong> value in a fulfillment listing policy.<br><br>This field is always required when overriding the shipping costs of a shipping service option, and will be always be returned for each shipping service option whose costs are being overridden.
 * @param shippingCost 
 * @param shippingServiceType This enumerated value indicates whether the shipping service specified in the <strong>priority</strong> field is a domestic or an international shipping service option. To override the shipping costs for a specific domestic shipping service in the fulfillment listing policy, this field should be set to <code>DOMESTIC</code>, and to override the shipping costs for each international shipping service, this field should be set to <code>INTERNATIONAL</code>. This value, along with <strong>priority</strong> value, sets which domestic or international shipping service option in the fulfillment policy that will be modified with updated shipping costs. Specifically, the <strong>shippingCostOverrides.shippingServiceType</strong> value in a <strong>createOffer</strong> or <strong>updateOffer</strong> call must match the <strong>shippingOptions.optionType</strong> value in a fulfillment listing policy, and the <strong>shippingCostOverrides.priority</strong> value in a <strong>createOffer</strong> or <strong>updateOffer</strong> call must match the <strong>shippingOptions.shippingServices.sortOrderId</strong> value in a fulfillment listing policy.<br><br>This field is always required when overriding the shipping costs of a shipping service option, and will be always be returned for each shipping service option whose costs are being overridden.
